AeroAssist is a mobile application developed with the primary objective of assisting the passengers in navigation, flight schedules, facilities, distress, emergency evacuations etc. 
///////////write implementation here///////////////////////////
The app would serve as a virtual airport guide and assistant throughout the time of its intended purpose and would make navigating easier and reduce hassle and delays at check-ins and 
would be a great tool for the management to evacuate civilians to safety in certain circumstances and prevents crowding and clustering. It also helps passengers to easily locate stores and  other facilities
thus enabling rapid and efficient means of commuting inside the airport.
